# Report of results in the first stage.

= Introduction =

The proposed first stage, in which was focused on the sequence component, has finished. Sangya's recommendations has served like a base line for the development process. The following steps describes the results obtained: 

  # The requirements gathering for the sequence component was collected by means of the template [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLyUK0jEc8KXAtlmUc7vX68wvR3k8AoSdkLVSKcK1M0/edit?hl=en_US Requirements Gathering Template] created in the way. The group [leader or in charge] persons has been helpful to describe the expected functionality.
  # The specification of the Sequence was created (available [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4FVZaxnjKPjnbokyEEcL7zHF7q3B5t8M6GYwlSzX2c/edit?hl=en_US here]) and the specification of the Biojs library in general as well (available [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG036Bvwl4i-KX5BTHddGzeE_5eospL-864BrnsAS_s/edit?hl=en_US here]). This document will be useful to define the common characteristics of the components belonging to the lib.
  # A mock-up was constructed in paper in order to show a prototype version to the user.
  # The sequence component was implemented in JavaScript (can see in repository). An example of usage is available (coming soon)
