==Minutes==

Start the project with simple examples
  * Collect feature requests from the PST project about how to represent a feature
  * Create specification
  * Create plug-in
  * Community test and feedback
  * Improve specification
  * Improve plug-in

Try to get a proof of concept

Proposed plug-ins to start with
  * Sequence
  * Ontology tree
  * References (bibliography)
  * External Services got this same request

Library of icons
  * Examples: biological representations, database icons, etc.
  * External Services is working on this (Visualisation group)
  * Suggestion of keeping a open registry of icons 

Set up communication infrastructure
  * Wiki
  * Mailing list

Other ideas discussed to take into account in the future
  * Have a SOA architecture (Registry of plug-ins, plug-ins as services, web application using plug-ins)

Include John in the EBI External services mailing list.
