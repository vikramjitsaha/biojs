The proposed first stage, in which was focused on the sequence component, has finished. Sangya's recommendations has served like a base line for the development process. The following steps describes the results obtained:

  1. The requirements gathering for the sequence component was collected by means of the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLyUK0jEc8KXAtlmUc7vX68wvR3k8AoSdkLVSKcK1M0/edit?hl=en_US) created in the way. The group (leader or in charge) persons has been helpful to describe the expected functionality.
  1. The specification of the Sequence was created (available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4FVZaxnjKPjnbokyEEcL7zHF7q3B5t8M6GYwlSzX2c/edit?hl=en_US)) and the specification of the Biojs library in general as well (available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gG036Bvwl4i-KX5BTHddGzeE_5eospL-864BrnsAS_s/edit?hl=en_US)). This document will be useful to define the common characteristics of the components belonging to the lib.
  1. A mock-up was constructed in paper in order to show a prototype version to the user.
  1. The sequence component was implemented in JavaScript (can see in repository). An example of usage is available (coming soon)
